Setup:
1: Create a folder in your servers httpd/www folder called something like "esp-server"...
2: Extract the esp-server zip and copy all files in esp folder to the new folder...
3: Edit the config.php file and if necessary chage the name and password for your server, the default is often root with no password...
4: Optional, edit the esp-server.sql and change the login information at line 88 or use the defrault: User: admin Pass: letmein

Database:
1: Using phpmyadmin create a database called esp-server...
2: Still using phpmyadmin, select the new database then select the SQL tab and paste in the contents from esp-server.sql file...

Now browse to you root (localhost or 127.0.0.1) and open the esp-server... example: http://127.0.0.1/esp-server/index.php

You should be presented with the login page, so enter Username = "admin" and Password = "letmein" (without quotes)...
