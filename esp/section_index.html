To run a server we only need only install Apache but to make it really useful we also need to install MySql for the database and php for the coding...<br /><br />

Luckily enough we can install all of these program in one go using one the available installers which also provide some basic administration...
You need to choose one of these installers for the WiKi link below... I tend to change from time to time but mostly use WampServer and Easyphp at the moment...
